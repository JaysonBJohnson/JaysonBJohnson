# About Me

Hey there, I'm **Jayson Johnson**, a dedicated Mechanical Engineering student and aspiring researcher from Howard University. Currently a Karsh STEM Scholar, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific exploration.

## Education and Research

- **Education:** B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (Expected: Jun 2026), GPA: 4.00/4.00
- **Minors:** Computer Science and Mathematics

As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at @FTERLab, I'm deeply involved in exploring the intricacies of hypersonic vehicles' heat transfer correlations and contributing to the Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder for the International Space Station (TIGERISS). From simulating hypersonic conditions to extracting data with Python scripts, I thrive in the world of hands-on research.

## Beyond the Lab

My journey expands beyond research labs. At NSF PARADIM - Johns Hopkins University, I'm advancing oxide synthesis through computational models, employing my skills in Python and machine learning to predict chemical equations and improve formation energy data.

As an Aspire Intern at John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, I tackled challenges in heat transfer correlations for space shuttles. Simulating hypersonic flow fields and developing screening tools, I explored the practical aspects of engineering.

## Awards & Achievements

- Vivien Thomas Scholar
- Paul Robeson Scholarship
- Delta Theta Sigma Scholarship
- Karsh STEM Scholar
- Third Place in ASME IMECE Poster Competition

## Building the Future

Beyond academia, I co-founded Tree Tech, a student-made app at Howard University, aimed at transforming educational experiences. Actively involved in professional organizations like ASME and NSBE, I'm dedicated to shaping the future of engineering.

## Let's Connect

If you're interested in discussing research, collaborating on projects, or just sharing ideas, I'm always open to new connections. Let's embark on a journey of innovation and learning together!
